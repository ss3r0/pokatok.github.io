            <h3>Music</h3>
          </header>
          <p>Streaming is how most of us get our music now. Physical sales and digital
downloads have been declining in our post-Napster world, and streaming is the dominant form of
distribution. Although there continues to be a lot of talk about streaming killing the music
industry and the measly royalties artists get paid from streaming, industry professionals should
give streaming more credit. Streaming has helped people listen to more music than ever before, it
is now easier for smaller and DIY artists to get their music heard, and it has largely eliminated
music piracy.</p>

          </header>
          <p>YouTube stars have recently become a staple of the entertainment industry, as millions of subscribers turn to easy, quick entertainment from the wide range of personalities on the internet. Gamers, in particular, have started to use YouTube as a platform to showcase their respective skills, comedic talents and personable attributes. We’ve seen Seth Abner (Scump) rise as a competitive gamer in OpTic Gaming and Felix Arvid Ulf Kjellberg (PewDiePie) star on Conan O’Brien’s Clueless Gamer series. These internet celebrities just get more and more powerful as technology and the Internet become more prominent in our lives.</p>

            <h3>Live Streaming</h3>
          </header>
          <p>In a diverse entertainment ecosystem where platforms jockey for a competitive edge, one area has seen impressive growth: live streaming. Live streaming has been around for years, quietly building momentum in the background. Today, the medium is poised to explode on a global scale, and the ripple effects will be felt throughout the entire entertainment landscape.</p>
          <p>The success of live streaming is due, in part, to the unexpected events of 2020. As social distancing requirements curbed traditionally physical experiences, live streams gave audiences the ability to connect virtually. Indeed, with 99% year-over-year growth of hours watched and a 45% growth between March and April 2020, it’s clear that live streaming has flourished. </p>

          </header>
          <p>The convenience level is really at the highest peak. Since the rise of online movies, more and more people are taking the turns into it. Especially those people who have been caught up with life’s responsibilities and work.

It is also actually more fun to watch online movies since you can watch old movies, up to the latest with English subs. You can also have unlimited times watching it.</p>

            <h3>The rise of Netflix</h3>
          </header>
          <p>Even before COVID took the world by storm, the “Streaming Wars” were well underway. In short, the term “Streaming Wars” refers to the global race for supremacy within streaming video on-demand (SVOD). Some participants offer their service via a freemium model, where customers can pay nothing and sit through commercials or pay a monthly subscription for no commercials and sometimes better content. Netflix, the subject of this piece, offers a subscription-based model where subscribers pay a monthly fee for unlimited access to the company’s streaming content library.</p>
          <p>The company navigated the global pandemic and increasing competition successfully in 2020 (01/19/2021 Shareholder Letter), adding 37 million paid subscribers and surpassing 200 million total paid subscribers. Revenue and operating profit grew 24% and 76% year-over-year to $25 billion and $4.6 billion, respectively. As of this writing (01/24/2021), the company has a market capitalization of ~$250 billion, making it roughly 80% the size of long-time media heavyweight Disney ($313 billion).</p>
